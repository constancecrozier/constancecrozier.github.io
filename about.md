# About Constance
Since September 2020 Constance has been a postdoctoral researcher at CU Boulder. Her interests lie at the intersection of operations research and power systems. She is particularly interested in the integration of residential demand response into future electricity systems. She was the developer for the Electric Stampede team in the [ARPA-E Grid Optimization Competition](https://gocompetition.energy.gov), winning [$140,000 prize money](https://gocompetition.energy.gov/challenges/challenge-2/Leaderboards/Final) in challenge 2.

Previously she worked at the UK Government, in the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy as a Technical Energy Specialist. There she advised on government policy regarding vehicle electrification, and developed the [SCORES](https://github.com/constancecrozier/SCORES) modeling framework.

She completed all of her degrees at the University of Oxford. Her PhD, in the [Energy and Power Group](https://epg.eng.ox.ac.uk), investigated the impacts that wide-spread electric vehicle charging would have on operation of electricity networks; both if consumers charge without intervention, and with smart charging. You can read her thesis [here](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:1cb55756-6cc6-45ea-aa6d-82a952ecaf7c/download_file?safe_filename=thesis_revised.pdf&type_of_work=Thesis).

Constance grew up in Lewisham, South East London - at almost exactly 0 degrees longitude! She enjoys running, hiking, climbing, and generally being outdoors.

The homestretch of Longs Peak. Descending the summit at 14,000 ft altitude (trying not to think about how far it was back to the car).

Grand Teton National Park in early May. It turns out that this is far too early in the year to visit, scrambled up the rocks because the trail was packed with several feet of snow.

Climbing in Shelf Road, one of Colorado's best winter climbing areas. Demonstrating my strongest climbing talent: resting.
