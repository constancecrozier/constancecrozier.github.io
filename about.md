# About Constance
Since September 2020 I have been a postdoctoral researcher at CU Boulder. My interests lie in the operation and composition of future low carbon power systems, especially regarding the integration of residential demand response. I was the developer for the Electric Stampede team in the [ARPA-E Grid Optimization Competition](https://gocompetition.energy.gov), winning [$140,000 prize money](https://gocompetition.energy.gov/challenges/challenge-2/Leaderboards/Final) in challenge 2.

Previously I worked in Government, at the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy as a Technical Energy Specialist. There I advised on government policy regarding vehicle electrification, and developed the [SCORES](https://github.com/constancecrozier/SCORES) modeling framework.

I received all of my degrees at the University of Oxford. My PhD, in the [Energy and Power Group](https://epg.eng.ox.ac.uk), investigated the impacts that wide-spread electric vehicle charging would have on operation of electricity networks; both if consumers charge without intervention, and with smart charging. You can read my thesis [here](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:1cb55756-6cc6-45ea-aa6d-82a952ecaf7c/download_file?safe_filename=thesis_revised.pdf&type_of_work=Thesis).

<h2>Outreach</h2>
I am very driven to reduce the socio-economic inequalities presently in academia. As an undergraduate I was the access and outreach representative of my college, and as a graduate student I volunteered at several outreach events. I am especially passionate about encouraging women and those from lower economic backgrounds into STEM.

I believe that free online resources can help to reduce the barriers faced by students from less privileged backgrounds. I have a [science communication blog](https://constancecrozier.wordpress.com/blog-2/) and helped create a [video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiJ1mvD0YRE) showing insight into the university admissions process.

<h2>Personal</h2>
I grew up in Lewisham, South East London - at almost exactly 0 degrees longitude! I enjoy running, hiking, climbing, and generally being outdoors.

The homestretch of Longs Peak. Descending the summit at 14,000 ft altitude (trying not to think about how far it was back to the car).

Grand Teton National Park in early May. It turns out that this is far too early in the year to visit, scrambled up the rocks because the trail was packed with several feet of snow.

Climbing in Shelf Road, one of Colorado's best winter climbing areas. Demonstrating my strongest climbing talent: resting.
