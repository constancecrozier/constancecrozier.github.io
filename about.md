title: About Constance
---

I was born in London, UK -- at almost exactly zero degrees longitude!

Since August 2023, I have been an Assistant Professor at Georgia Tech ISyE. My interests lie in the operation and composition of future low carbon power systems, especially regarding the integration of large-scale demand response.

Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at CU Boulder.  I was the developer for the Electric Stampede team in the [ARPA-E Grid Optimization Competition](https://gocompetition.energy.gov), winning [$270,000 prize money](https://gocompetition.energy.gov/challenges/challenge-2/Leaderboards/Final) in challenge 2 and 3.

Previously I worked in Government, at the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy as a Technical Energy Specialist. There I advised on government policy regarding vehicle electrification, and developed the [SCORES](https://github.com/constancecrozier/SCORES) modeling framework.

I received all of my degrees at the University of Oxford. My PhD, in the [Energy and Power Group](https://epg.eng.ox.ac.uk), investigated the impacts that wide-spread electric vehicle charging would have on operation of electricity networks; both if consumers charge without intervention, and with smart charging. You can read my thesis [here](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:1cb55756-6cc6-45ea-aa6d-82a952ecaf7c/download_file?safe_filename=thesis_revised.pdf&type_of_work=Thesis).

I have a number of hobbies, which mostly revolve around spending time outside. See images below.
