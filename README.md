Welcome to my personal website. My research concerns development of control strategies for distributed assets which take into account human behavior, or human-in-the-loop. I got my PhD from the University of Oxford in the [Energy and Power Group](https://epg.eng.ox.ac.uk), and am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [GRIFFIN Lab](http://www.kyrib.com) at CU Boulder. I am on the 22-23 academic job market.
